# Launch Sign-off — CI / Build / Lint / Typecheck / Tests / Audit

This document records the green verification run that satisfies launch
blocker **#4 (UNVERIFIED)** — "Run and verify CI / build / lint /
typecheck / tests / audit". It is intended as a checkpoint reference;
re-run the steps below before each subsequent launch milestone and
update the table.

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) is triggered on every PR
into `main` / `staging`, so the canonical "green CI run" is the
latest passing PR. The most recent merged PRs (#445, #446, #447) and
the open #448 all show **7/7 checks green**.

## Notes & caveats

- **Lint warnings (4855):** all are `i18next/no-literal-string`,
  `jsx-a11y/no-static-element-interactions`, and similar style
  warnings. CI treats only **errors** as fail-the-build. They are
  tracked separately and should be burned down post-launch but are
  not launch-blocking.
- **`Deploy to Cloudflare Workers` workflow** has been failing on
  recent `main` commits at the `Set up job` step. This is an
  infrastructure/secret problem in the deploy workflow only — it is
  unrelated to source quality and does not appear in the PR CI
  matrix. Should be triaged separately before a real deploy attempt.
- **Bundle size budget** is checked in CI as part of the `Lint, Type
Check & Tests` job (`Bundle size budget check` step) with a 250 kB
  shared-JS limit per `AGENTS.md`. The PR matrix is green, so the
  budget is currently respected.
- **E2E** is run in CI with an ephemeral Supabase project. Re-running
  it locally requires `supabase start` + `npm run build` +
  `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`. The CI matrix is the
  source of truth for E2E.

## How to re-verify before the next launch milestone

```bash
# from a clean checkout of main
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
npm audit
```

For E2E, prefer the CI run on a PR rather than reproducing locally:

```bash
gh pr view <pr-number> --json statusCheckRollup
```

…or simply look at the green checkmarks on the PR page.
